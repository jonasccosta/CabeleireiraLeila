# CabeleireiraLeila

Inspired by a video that went viral in 2020 in Brazil, I developed an app using Java and Android Studio that allows clients to schedule hairdresser appointments with Cabeleireira Leila. It contains a portfolio of previous hair and nails works, and it sends an email to the client with the details about their appointment. Although I built it in a humourous manner, this app was an interesting way I found to learn native Android Development.
